        <h2 id="hosting">Hosting <small>Because Minecraft doesn't run on potatoes</small></h2>
        <p>Since our user expansion in September '13, we were capable to cough up the funds for a <em>real</em> server. We are now running on a dedicated server from <a href="http://www.nessus.at/">Nessus</a>, where other services known for their <a href="http://www.soup.io/">magnificient performance</a> have been hosted on before. Specifically, <a href="http://www.nessus.at/produkte/rootserver/l">this is our current server</a>. It seems to be able to handle our server with reasonable load while also generating our <a href="http://overview.wurstmineberg.de">map overview</a> once a day, so it's quite the step up from our previous vServer solution.</p>
        <p>Before the rootserver, we used a basic vServer. Nothing fancy, 1-2GB RAM, a single CPU core, 50Gigs of space. As more people joined the server, we needed to upgrade sooner or later for reasons of advanced lag and frustration.</p>
        <p>As our step up before the vServer, we were using <a href="https://cubedhost.org/minecraft#overview">CubedHost</a> as our server host, and… Well, Everything worked fine (except for one 24h downtime we never found out the reason for), but since we only had access via FTP and <a href="http://www.multicraft.org/">Multicraft</a>, we soon ran out of stuff to tinker with. And besides, easy and fast snapshot updates, automated backups to different machines and all that aren't really fun to do without shell/ssh access. Since we cancelled the CubedHost server in August '13, we've been using it as a creative mirror server of the primary world where designs and mechanics could be tested more easily, and since its shutdown on september 1st, <a href="http://wurstmannberg.de/people#fenhl">Fenhl</a> has been providing a similiar mirror for these things.</p>
        <p>Even before we tried CubedHost, the server was set up on a spare Laptop in Jemus42's apartment. Back then only Jemus42 and BenemitC where playing (needing a way to continue their multiplayer map they started with… less physical distance), so that actually worked. Kind of.So yeah, I guess you could say we've come a long way since then.</p>

        <h2 id="starter">Getting started</h2>
        <p>If you're new and don't know where to go and what to do, chances are you didn't get a server tour by one of our more senior members. Sorry about that. The first thing you'll see is our spawn area, which is rather obviously still being built, like so many things on the server. "Beneath" the spawn area is our Nether Hub, which serves as a central community trafficing area and connects various tunnels to other peoples's nether portals. Both the nether hub and spawn area are community oriented builds. All the supplies there are either donated or specifically collected for specific builds or purposes, so … Well, the general rule is "Don't be a dick". If something has a sign with "free to take" on it, you can probably take it. Taking <em>everything</em> is generally frowned upon for reasons of obviousness. Also, even if there are usually some community supplies floating around (like steak), please don't rely on them as your only means of, you know, not starving to death.</p>
        <p> If you'd like to work on community builds like spawners, farms or whatever, please try to ask around some of the other people who may or may not have already started preparations for such builds. It's not about <em>owning</em> a community project, it's just about coordination and not stepping on people's toes. However, experience shows that you probably won't be murdered in your sleep if you build at spawn without discussing every minor detail with everyone. Hanging around on the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#wurstmineberg">IRC channel</a> and/or checking out the <a href="http://twitter.com/wurstmineberg">Twitter account</a> and/or checking out the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg">subreddit front page</a> should give a start as to what's currently going on. And sometimes it doesn't.</p>
        <p>As I was saying, it's about community. As long as you're being reasonable and remember you're not alone on this server (both for your and everybody elses' benefit), everything's fine.</p>

        <p>To finance our server, we thought it'd be a nice idea to copy <a href="http://uberspace.de">Uberspace's</a> model: You settle for the amount you want to contribute every month and send that to Jemus42, who rented and pays the server. The relevant reddit threads are <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg/comments/1lykcp/geldgeldgeld/">here for the pledges, where people said what they's be willing to contribute</a> and the older thread about <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg/comments/1k5abo/psa_sollten_wir_ein_vserverupgrade_wollen_dies/">the general situation and what server we'd be getting</a>. There's also a private spreadsheet where Jemus42 collects data about what everyone has pledged to pay, what expenses we have and of course the actual transactions will be collected there as well. For obvious reasons, this isn't be public.</p>
        <p>To contribute, you'll need to talk to Jemus42. You can chat him up via Jabber at <a href="xmpp:jemus42@kuchen.io"><code>jemus42@kuchen.io</code></a>.</p>
